Hello,
You have 6 hours to complete the task, send whatever you manage to complete.
The Task:
Implement the formula input functionality as it is seen in pry.
You must go to pry.co, and edit a formula to see the entire functionality - DO NOT START THE TASK UNTIL YOU DID.  
Go to pry.co
Signup for a free trial
Go to the models page
Open the formula input and play with it to understand it

We are looking for functionality first!, design is a second priority (but also very important).

You can use whatever libraries and online solutions you find, we encourage you to search for solutions that will help you implement them.

Hint - Think about what kind of tools coders are using that look similar to this functionality of a hybrid input with autocomplete
Features :
managing local state in Zustand
manage API state in React Query - Use this endpoint for autocomplete suggestions in React query
Formula Input Features:
Supporting operands between tags - (+,-,\*,(,),^,/â€¦..)
Supporting writing between tags
Deleting a TAG
Autocomplete suggestions - Support autocomplete also after an operand is written
Editing in each tag the (x) sign (Writing inside the tag as an input) - See pry in tag editing
Calculating values is a bonus (Assign some dummy variable values and accept the operations).

Good Luck
